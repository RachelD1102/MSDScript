# MSDScript
MSDScript is a programming language supported by the interpreter. MSDScript provides a range of tools and functions to make it easier for programmers to do some simple computations without memory leaks. It currently supports addition, multiplication and user-defined function evaluation, conditional statements and comparison operation and code optimizer. 

MSDscript could be used as an embedded language to help programmer build applications. For example, someone implementing a calendar program might want to have a language for advanced users to calculate dates for repeated meetings (say, more sophisticated than "every Tuesday"), and MSDScript could just about work for that.

Here is the complete documentation, which will be very helpful to you: [MSDScript Documentation](https://racheld0022019.gitbook.io/msdscript/).
